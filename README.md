![logo](https://github.com/Narusawa-T/RWDExpress/blob/main/RWDExpress_small.png)

**"RWD Express"**. The package is to help creating SAS packages. <br>Shaping onigiri(rice ball) by hands can be a bit challenging for beginners, but using onigiri mold makes it easy to form and provides a great introduction. Hope the mold(RWDExpress) will help you to create your SAS package.

## %index_single_key() : excel to package
1. **Put information** of SAS package you want to create **into an excel file** <br>(you can find template file in ./RWDExpress/addcnt)
2. %ex2pac(excel_file, package_location, complete_generation) will convert the excel into SAS package structure(folders and files) and execute %generatePackage() (optional) to package zip file

Sample code:
~~~sas
%ex2pac(
	excel_file=C:\Temp\template_package.xlsx,   /* Path of input excel file */
	package_location=C:\Temp\SAS_PACKAGES\packages,   /* Output path */
	complete_generation=Y)   /* Set Y(default) to execute %generagePackage() for completion */
~~~
**This allows you to create SAS packages via simple format of excel!**

## %pac2ex() : package to excel
Under construction, stay tuned!
